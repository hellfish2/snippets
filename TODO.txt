Things I (or anyone interested in contributing) need to fix:
============================================================
- AJAX submission doesn't handle any "bad" reponses very well.
- The .snippets folder doesn't get hidden immediately (as it's supposed to)
- Need to add a delete functionality in the snippet browser
- Need to make TinyMCE remove the snippet button when the add-on is uninstalled
- More unit tests
- Remove the snippet button when editing a snippet. (Somehow....TinymCE is a cruel mistress)

Next phase of developement:
===========================
- Move snippets to a Dexterity object
- Incorporate workflows
- User/Role based security restrictions on adding/editing
- Allow for snippet folder hierarchy
- Plone 5 testing/integration
- Search functionality?
- JS unit testing?
